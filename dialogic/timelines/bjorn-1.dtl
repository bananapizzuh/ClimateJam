bjorn: Yeahhhhhhh, they have been bribing a TON of politicians, and at this point, nobody wants them.

taco: Great. I'm collecting signatures of the local mayors, and I'm trying to kick out Pollution Inc.

bjorn: *Bjorn signs the petition*
bjorn: So now youâ€™ve collected the signatures, you gotta deliver it to the CEO. His tower is just next door. They probably won't let you in, so you gotta climb up the tower.
